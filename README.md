```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

If you prefer to host the static build on GitHub Pages instead of Lovable, follow these steps:

1. **Set the base path:** add a `.env` (or repository secret in GitHub Actions) with the path that matches your repository name:

   ```
   VITE_APP_BASE_PATH=local-tour-manager
   ```

   If you are publishing from a project root on `https://<username>.github.io/`, leave this variable empty so the base defaults to `/`.

2. **Switch routing to hash mode:** the application now uses `HashRouter`, which works out of the box on static hosts such as GitHub Pages.

3. **Build the production bundle:**

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

   The static files will be generated in `dist/`.

4. **Publish to GitHub Pages:** serve the contents of `dist/` from the `gh-pages` branch (or the `/docs` folder) using the method you prefer:

   - Manually copy the build output to the branch that Pages is configured to serve.
   - Or automate with GitHub Actions. A minimal workflow could look like:

     ```yaml
     name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

     on:
       push:
         branches: [main]

     jobs:
       build-and-deploy:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - uses: actions/checkout@v4
           - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
             with:
               node-version: 20
           - run: npm ci
           - run: npm run build
             env:
               VITE_SUPABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.VITE_SUPABASE_URL }}
               VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: ${{ secrets.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY }}
               VITE_APP_BASE_PATH: ${{ secrets.VITE_APP_BASE_PATH }}
           - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
             with:
               path: dist
           - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
     ```

5. **Configure Supabase environment variables:** make sure the Supabase keys are provided as GitHub repository secrets (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) so the build can access your backend.

After the workflow completes, your app will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.
